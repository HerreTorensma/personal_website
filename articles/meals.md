All recipes are vegetarian, and I try to make them so they use at few dishes/cutlery as possible.
All the portion sizes are for one person, but they could of course be expanded to accomodate multiple people.

## Enchiladas
Ingredients:

- 400g beans in chili sauce
- 2 tortillas
- Some Gouda or Cheddar cheese
- 1 tomato
- 1 onion or 1 avocado
- Lime or lemon juice
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 clove of garlic
- Greek yoghurt or sour cream

Things you have to wash afterwards:

- Plate
- Fork and knife for eating
- Sharp knife for cutting vegetables
- Spoon for yoghurt
- Cheese slicer
- I use baking paper so I don't need to wash an oven tray

Steps:

1. Put half of the beans in one tortilla and fold up
2. Repeat with the other half and another tortilla
3. Slice cheese and put on top
4. Bake in oven for 20 - 30 minutes at 30 degrees Celsius
5. While it's baking I make either (depending on what I have in the house):
    - Guacamole:
        - Mash an avocado or dice it if it's not ripe enough
        - Dice a tomato and mix with the avocado
        - Cut up garlic
        - Mix and add lime/lemon juice, salt, pepper
    - Pico de gallo:
        - Cut up an onion
        - Cut up a tomato
        - Mix and add salt, pepper, lime/lemon juice, perhaps garlic
    - The point is to have some fresh vegetables as topping, obviously you can make whatever you want
6. After it's done baking I put some Greek yoghurt on top of the enchiladas and add my guacamole/pico de gallo

## Curry
Ingredients:

- Paneer
- Rice
- Onion
- Spinach or green peas
- Curry spice mix (sorry this is not a proper recipe)
- Chili flakes
- Lime or lemon juice
- Olive oil

Things you have to wash afterwards:

- Slightly bowl-shaped plate for serving
- Pot for rice
- Frying pan or skillet for the curry
- Spatula
- Fork and knife

Steps:

1. Cut paneer into cubes
2. Dice onion
3. Fry paneer in olive oil till most sides are brown
4. Add the diced onion
5. Fry till brown
6. Add garlic
7. Add spinach/green peas
8. Add spice mix, chili flakes, salt, lime or lemon juice
9. Perhaps add some more olive oil
10. Fry to satisfaction
